# ng-inspector

__ng-inspector__ is a Safari extension that displays an inspector panel showing the AngularJS scope hierarchy in the current page in real time, as well as which controllers or directives are associated with which scope.

Hovering over a scope in the inspector will highlight with a blue border the DOM element that scope is attached to, as well as any bindings with a red border. Clicking on a model will console.log that model's contents.

The extension adds a toolbar icon with the AngularJS logo that toggles the pane on and off.
